*Environment variable : The environment variables are dynamic values that are stored within a system and used by applications launched in shells or sub-shells. 
                        
                        e.g name ="Max" in the BASH shell. 

* .bashrc               : The .bashrc file is a script file thatâ€™s executed when a user logs in. 
                         The contents of .bashrc can be changed to define functions, command aliases, and customize the bash. 
                         bashrc can be used to define functions that reduce redundant efforts. These functions can be a collection of basic commands. 
                         These functions can even use arguments from the terminal.

                         How?

                         nano .bashrc
                         {decalre a variable here or build a function which you need to use repeatedly}
