* Range-based for loop:

    We can use range-based for loops. In this type of loop, we can specify the number to start, to stop, and to increment at every iteration(optional) in the statement. 

    eg:

    for num in {1..5};
    do 
        echo $num
    done


    --> Skipping numbers using for loops:

        eg: 

        for num in {1..100..2};
        do
            echo $num
        done

        {The above piece of code will print all the odd numbers from 1-99, by skipping one digit}
