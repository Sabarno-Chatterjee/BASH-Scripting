* adduser or addgroup :

    adduser and addgroup add users and groups to the system according to command line options and configuration information in /etc/adduser.conf.

    e.g:

    sudo adduser <user_name> 

* cat /etc/passwd:

    To view all the users.

* passwd:

    The passwd command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal user may only change the password for their own account, while the superuser may change the password for any
    account.

    sudo passwd <user_name>
    funny for loki

* usermod:

    The usermod command modifies the system account files to reflect the changes that are specified on the command line.

    e.g:

    sudo usermod <user_name> -s /bin/bash {here we are changing the shell for the user using usermod}

* sudo or super user do:

     sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.  The invoking user's real (not effective) user-ID is used to
     determine the user name with which to query the security policy.

* su:

      su allows commands to be run with a substitute user and group ID.

      su - <user_name> {The user name you want to change to.}


* visudo:

     visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to vipw(8).  visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, performs basic validity checks, and checks
     for syntax errors before installing the edited file.  If the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try again later.

* userdel:

      userdel is a low level utility for removing users. On Debian, administrators should usually use deluser(8) instead.

       The userdel command modifies the system account files, deleting all entries that refer to the user name LOGIN. The named user must exist.
